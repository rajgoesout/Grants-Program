## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### Tagline: One-click crypto tax computation for Polkadot, Kusama and their parachains.

#### A brief description of your project

Calculating and filing taxes for Polkadot/Kusama and its parachains is a strenuous and time-consuming process. Existing solutions don't fully solve it, and offer a poor user experience. ClearDotTax aims to give users their Polkadot tax report for their jurisdiction in one click.

#### Relation to Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama

Substrate/Dotsama is a challenging ecosystem to track transactions and estimate tax liability using existing crypto tax tools. While solutions like subscan track all transactions across parachains, they don't track accrued income such as lending/staking/yield farm rewards. More details [here](#what-needs-does-your-project-meet-how-did-you-identify-these-needs-please-provide-evidence-in-the-form-of-scientific-articles-forum-discussions-case-studies-or-raw-data).

| ------------------------------------------------------ |

#### Team Motivation

Our team has been both, users, as well as builders in the Polkadot ecosystem for almost 3 years. We have found it really hard to calculate our taxes, especially as power-users having a lot of transactions in multiple protocols. After exploring the community forums and discord, we found that a lot of users are facing the same problem. This is where our team has a unique experience, having spent time building tools to reduce information asymmetry across blockchain networks (including Polkadot).

### Ecosystem Fit

#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

We simplify tax computation for users of Polkadot/Kusama and their parachains.

#### Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Users of Polkadot/Kusama and their parachains who want to file their taxes/see their taxable income in the Dotsama ecosystem (for now, users based in the US, UK, Germany, and Switzerland).

#### What need(s) does your project meet? How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.

#### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

- [Polkalytics](https://www.polkalytics.io)
  - [you still need to hire a tax consultant](https://grillapp.net/10716/polkalytics-a-google-scale-analytics-service-for-polkadot-37079)
  - the [reports generated](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14WqTKlAR6bfb2zr5VqxOEn0WWdPsc1j1) don't tell us our total tax liability, and have complex labels, making it hard to understand for end-users.
- [cointracking_polka](https://github.com/TheGoldenEye/cointracking_polka) and [staking-rewards-collector](https://github.com/w3f/staking-rewards-collector) help calculate income from staking. However, they don't provide an easy-to-use UX and don't support income from any other category.
- [polkadot-portfolio](https://github.com/substrate-portfolio/polkadot-portfolio) and [Polkaholic](https://twitter.com/polkaholic_io) fetch account balances from `frame-system`. However, it doesn't work for custom pallets and accrued rewards/fees from custom protocols.

#### Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

- [CoinTracker](https://www.cointracker.io/)
- [Koinly](https://app.koinly.io/)
- [Netrunner](https://www.netrunner.tax/) - on Solana

However, the above tools don't have support for Polkadot/Kusama and their Parachains (except EVM based ones).

### Project Details

#### Key Deliverables

- ##### Backend API
  To fetch users' transactions across Polkadot and Kusama relay chains; and all major parachains of Polkadot & Kusama (ones supported by Subscan).
- ##### [Transactions Dashboard](#milestone-1--transactions-dashboard)
  To view and filter all transactions/income.
- ##### Advanced transactions module

  To track users' accrued income (fees/rewards) across the supported protocols:

  1.  Lending Protocols<br/>
      a. Moonwell
  2.  Staking Protocols<br/>
      a. Native DOT<br/>
      b. Manta<br/>
      c. Astar<br/>
      d. Hydradx<br/>
      e. Acala & Karura
  3.  Yield Farms<br/>
      a. Stellaswap
  4.  Liquidity Pools<br/>
      a. Stellaswap<br/>
      b. Acala & Karura

- ##### Wallet Connection UX

- ##### One-click Tax Report UX
  To view/download tax report for your jurisdiction (starting with the US, UK, Germany, and Switzerland) in a selected time period.

#### Data Models

##### transactions:

|         field |           type |
| ------------: | -------------: |
|        amount |          float |
|      currency |        varchar |
|     value_usd |          float |
|         gains |          float |
|           fee |          float |
|      category | IncomeCategory |
|          time |      timestamp |
|           tag |        varchar |
|     src_chain |        varchar |
|    dest_chain |        varchar |
|   sender_addr |        varchar |
| receiver_addr |        varchar |

##### custom types:

|      type name |                   type |
| -------------: | ---------------------: |
| IncomeCategory | enum (ACCRUED, DIRECT) |

#### Technology Stack

The backend service would be written in a mix of Rust and TypeScript; GraphQL API in TypeScript; and the frontend using Next.js. We will use MongoDB to store any transactions/tax report/user data.

#### Non-Goals

- Our platform will not provide tax advice/ways to reduce tax liability. We will simply show the tax liability of the user in the supported jurisdictions, and the supported protocols, as mentioned in [Key Deliverables](#key-deliverables).

## Future Plans

- **How we intend to finance the project's long-term maintenance and development:**
  - We plan to charge a small fee for helping users compute their taxes. It would follow a freemium model - one trial run, and subsequent runs would be charged/require a subscription to our platform. This will help cover our infrastructure costs and reduce our reliance on grants.
- **How we intend to use, enhance, and promote your project in the short term:**
  - We plan to build a discord community for users to ask crypto tax related questions. This will help promote our project organically.
  - We intend to onboard our first 100 users within one month of the grant's conclusion.
- **The team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it:**
  - In the long-term, we want to make the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem more easier to use for end-users.
  - Add support for more jurisdictions.
  - Make adapters like [DefiLlama](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters) to make it easy for anyone to add support for new protocols/chains.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

- **If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project:**
  - None
- **Previous grants you may have applied for:**
  - None for this project. Our team has taken w3f grants earlier to build [YieldScan](https://twitter.com/YieldScan)
